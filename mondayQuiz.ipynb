    "The quiz is short and combines topics covered in both the lecture and homeworks. If you are struggling, go back through the other notebooks to look for the answers. The quiz is designed to test how well you're learning to put code together more than just if you remember the right operators and functions, so don't be ashamed to look things up. Try to spend as much time as you can to figure out a correct answer before you look at the answer key."
